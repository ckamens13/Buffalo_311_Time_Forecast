## The objective of this notebook was to create a forecast for 311 Calls in 2023 based off of previous years. 
---
### In this notebook, three models were created and compared. The first model includes US holidays from the holidays module, the second model does not include any holidays, and the third model contains additional "Buffalo holidays". 
---
### After evaluating the models, there is not a drastic difference between them. The number of calls that 311 recieves in a day is not largely dependent on if the day is considered a holiday or not. Some days have a lower call volume but these days are not always holidays. 
---
### The model without holidays included is likely the best predictor due to a high R-squared, and lower mean squared error, and RMSE. 
---
### An interesting observation is that there seems to be large increase in daily call volume in months from May to September. One reason for this could be that residents are more likely to observe problems in roads, street lights, etc. as they spend more time outside in the summer months.
